	1.	Heat the Pan: Place a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of oil or butter. Allow it to heat until the butter melts and starts to bubble, or the oil is shimmering.
	2.	Crack the Egg: Carefully crack an egg into a small bowl. This helps avoid shell fragments and makes it easier to gently slide the egg into the pan.
	3.	Cook the Egg: Gently slide the egg from the bowl into the heated pan. Cook the egg without flipping it, allowing the whites to set while keeping the yolk runny. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes.
	4.	Serve: Once the whites are fully set and the yolk is still runny, use a spatula to carefully lift the egg from the pan and transfer it to a plate. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve immediately.
